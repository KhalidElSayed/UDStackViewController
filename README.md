=========

UDStackViewController similar to what @linkedin app uses for it's main view...
check out how it works @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHbUXie7a34

Requirements
----------
You will need LLVM 3.0+ to build, but code is iOS4.0+. (actualy iOS4.0+ only because of animation blocks - could be ported to 3.0 easy)
If you want to use other compile move all declarations from .m to .h

What's different on this branch from v0.1
----------
There is v0.1 also - its implementation differs from this one. You should check both if you looking for something like this. 
This version rewrite from scrach of v0.1. It uses single navigation controller you should use instead of UINavigationController.

How To Use It
-------------
basically it's same UINavigationControler. Check attached project.
